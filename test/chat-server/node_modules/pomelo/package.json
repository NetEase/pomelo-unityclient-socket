We also provide many plugins like online status, master high availability.\n* Custom features, users can define their own network protocol, custom components very easy.\n\n## Why should I use pomelo?\nFast, scalable, real-time game server development is not an easy job, and a good container or framework can reduce its complexity.\nUnfortunately, unlike web, finding a game server framework solution is difficult, especially an open source solution. Pomelo fills this gap, providing a full solution for building game server frameworks.\nPomelo has the following advantages:\n* The architecture is scalable. It uses a multi-process, single thread runtime architecture, which has been proven in the industry and is especially suited to the node.js thread model.\n* Easy to use, the development model is quite similar to web, using convention over configuration, with almost zero config. The [API](http://pomelo.netease.com/api.html) is also easy to use.\n* The framework is extensible. Based on the node.js micro module principle, the core of pomelo is small. All of the components, libraries and tools are individual npm modules, and anyone can create their own module to extend the framework.\n* The reference materials and documentation are quite complete. In addition to the documentation, we also provide [an open-source MMO RPG demo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Introduction-to--Lord-of-Pomelo) (HTML5 client), which is a far better reference material than any book.\n\n## How can I develop with pomelo?\nWith the following references, you can quickly familiarize yourself with the pomelo development process:\n* [Pomelo documents](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki)\n* [Getting started](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Welcome-to-Pomelo)\n* [Tutorial](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Preface)\n\n\n## Contributors\n* NetEase, Inc.
