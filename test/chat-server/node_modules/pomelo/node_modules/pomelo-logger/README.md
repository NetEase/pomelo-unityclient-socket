pomelo-logger
========

pomelo-logger is a [log4js](https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node) wrapper for [pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo) which provides some useful features.  

## Installation
```
npm install pomelo-logger
```

## Features
### log prefix
besides category, you can output prefix as you like in your log  
prefix can be filename, serverId, serverType, host etc  
to use this feature, you just pass prefix params to getLogger function  
```
var logger = require('pomelo-logger').getLogger(category, prefix1, prefix2, ...);
```
 log output msg will output with prefix ahead   

### get line number in debug
when in debug environment, you may want to get the line number of the log  
to use this feature, add this code   
```
process.env.LOGGER_LINE = true;
```

in pomelo, you just configure the log4js file and set **lineDebug** for true  
```
{
  "appenders": [
  ],

  "levels": {
  }, 

  "replaceConsole": true,

  "lineDebug": true
}
```
### dynamic configure logger level
in pomelo logger configuration file log4js.json, you can add reloadSecs option. The reloadSecs means reload logger configuration file every given time. For example
```
{
	"reloadSecs": 30
}
```
the above configuration means reload the configuration file every 30 seconds. You can dynamic change the logger level, but it does not support dynamiclly changing configuration of appenders.

## Example
log.js
```
var logger = require('pomelo-logger').getLogger('log', __filename, process.pid);

process.env.LOGGER_LINE = true;
logger.info('test1');
logger.warn('test2');
logger.error('test3');
```
